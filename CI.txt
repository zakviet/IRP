What is CI

- a development methodology
- of daily developer integrations
- verified by automated builds

Continuous compilation != Continuous Integration

why do it?
Building software can be a risky business

Fixing bugs late is costly

Lack of team cohesion
when did we decided to upgrade the version of our project?
I thought you fixed that 2 months ago.


Better
Build better quality software
That is tested early and often
That adheres to best practices and coding standards


Faster
Test in parallel, not at the end
No integration points
Builds become a non event

Cheaper
Identify defects earlier
Fix when least costly
Easily repeatable testing

Build Ingredients
------------------
compilation
Test execution
Database integration
code inspection(idenfited problems early, best practices)
Documentation generation

compilation - on every target platform

When do I build?
At every checkin
every time dependency changes
